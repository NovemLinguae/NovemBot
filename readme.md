## Novem Linguae's Wikipedia bots

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NovemBot

- Task A - Edit own userspace to keep accurate lists of users who have permissions, for use with User:Novem Linguae/Scripts/UserHighlighterSimple.
- Task 1 - Promote featured and good topic candidates. Summon the bot to a FGTC voting page using {{User:NovemBot/Promote}} ~~~~. Person adding the template must be on the whitelist.

I have some AWB, one time run bot tasks as well, but those are not documented here.
